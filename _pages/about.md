I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I work in the [Salapaka Lab](http://salapakalab.ece.umn.edu/), at the [Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/ece) and I'm advised by Prof. Murti Salapaka.
My thesis is on the development of experimental as well as analytical tools needed to model the mechanical properties of proteins at the single molecule scale. This research is at the intersection of system identification, biophysics, statistical mechanics, and machine learning.    

<!--- Write your biography here (Test Test). Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
