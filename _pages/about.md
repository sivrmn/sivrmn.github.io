I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I work in the [Salapaka Lab](http://salapakalab.ece.umn.edu/), at the [Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/ece) and I'm advised by [Prof. Murti Salapaka](https://cse.umn.edu/ece/murti-salapaka).

<!--- Write your biography here (Test Test). Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
