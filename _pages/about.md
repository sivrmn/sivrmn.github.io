I am a Research Fellow at the [Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics](https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/artificial-intelligence-informatics/overview), [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/). I obtained my Ph.D. from the [University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/ece) with a minor in [Computer Science](https://cse.umn.edu/cs). I was advised by [Prof. Murti Salapaka](http://salapakalab.ece.umn.edu/). My thesis was on the development of experimental as well as analytical tools needed to model the mechanical properties of proteins at the single molecule scale. My research is at the intersection of system identification, biophysics, statistical mechanics, and machine learning.

<!--- Write your biography here (Test Test). Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
